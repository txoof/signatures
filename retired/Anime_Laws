apply.

#2 - Law of Differentiated Gravitation: Whenever someone or something
jumps, is thrown, or otherwise is rendered air born, gravity is reduced by
a factor of 4.

#3 - Law of Sonic Amplification, First Law of Anime Acoustics: In space,
loud sounds, like explosions, are even louder because there is no air to
get in the way.

#4 - Law of Constant Thrust, First Law of Anime Motion: In space, constant
thrust equals constant velocity.

#5 - Law of Mechanical Mobility, Second Law of Anime Motion: The larger a
mechanical device is, the faster it moves. Armored Mecha are the fastest
objects known to human science.

#6 - Law of Temporal Variability: Time is not a constant. Time stops for
the hero whenever he does something 'cool' or 'impressive'. Time slows
down when friends and lovers are being killed and speeds up whenever there
is a fight. 
%
The 25 Laws of Japanese Animation
#7 - First Law of Temporal Mortality: 'Good Guys' and 'Bad Guys' both die
in one of two ways. Either so quick they don't even see it coming, OR it's
a long drawn out affair where the character gains much insight to the
workings of society, human existence or why the toast always lands butter
side down. 
%
The 25 Laws of Japanese Animation
#8 - Second Law of Temporal Mortality: It takes some time for bad guys to
die... regardless of physical damage. Even when the 'Bad Guys' are killed
so quickly they didn't even see it coming, it takes them a while to
realize they are dead. This is attributed to the belief that being evil
damages the Reality Lobe of the brain.

#9 - Law of Dramatic Emphasis: Scenes involving extreme amounts of action
are depicted with either still-frames or black screens with a slash of
bright color (usually red or white). 
%
The 25 Laws of Japanese Animation
#10 - Law of Dramatic Multiplicity: Scenes that only happen once, for
instance, a 'Good Guy' kicks the 'Bad Guy' in the face, are seen at least
3 times from 3 different angles.

#11 - Law of Inherent Combustibility: Everything explodes. Everything. 
	First Corollary: Anything that explodes bulges first.

#12 - Law of Phlogistatic Emission: Nearly all things emit light from
fatal wounds. 
%
The 25 Laws of Japanese Animation
#13 - Law of Energetic Emission: There is always an energy build up
(commonly referred to as an energy 'bulge') before Mecha or spacecraft
weapons fire. Because of the explosive qualities of weapons, it is
believed that this is related to the Law of Inherent Combustibility.

#14 - Law of Inverse Lethal Magnitude: The destructive potential of a
weapon is inversely proportional to its size. 
%

#15 - Law of Inexhaustibility: No one *EVER* runs out of ammunition. That
is of course unless they are cornered, out-numbered, out-classed, and
unconscious. 
%

#16 - Law of Inverse Accuracy: The accuracy of a 'Good Guy' when operating
any form of firearm increases as the difficulty of the shot increases. The
accuracy of the 'Bad Guys' when operating firearms decreases when the
difficulty of the shot decreases. (Also known as the Stormtrooper
Effect) Example: A 'Good Guy' in a drunken stupor being held upside down
from a moving vehicle will always hit, and several battalions of 'Bad
Guys' firing on a 'Good Guy' standing alone in the middle of an open field
will always miss. 
	First Corollary: The more 'Bad Guys' there are, the less likely they 
	will hit anyone or do any real damage. 

	Second Corollary: Whenever a 'Good Guy' is faced with
	insurmountable odds, the 'Bad Guys' line up in neat rows, allowing
	the hero to take them all out with a single burst of automatic
	fire and then escape.  
	
	Third Corollary: Whenever a 'Good Guy' is actually hit by
	enemy fire, it is in a designated 'Good Guy Area', usually a flesh
	wound in the shoulder or arm, which restricts the 'Good Guy' from
	doing anything more strenuous than driving, firing weaponry,
	using melee weapons, operating heavy machinery, or doing complex
	martial arts maneuvers.

#17 - Law of Transient Romantic Unreliability: Minmei is a bimbo. (*
Note: The Minority Opposition in Ohio disagrees and thinks all men who
like this stuff need to get out more. *)

#18 - Law of Hemoglobin Capacity: The human body contains over 12 gallons
of blood. Sometimes more. 
%
The 25 Laws of Japanese Animation
#19 - Law of Demonic Consistency: Demons and other supernatural creatures
have at least three eyes, loads of fangs, tend to be yellow-green or
brown, but black is not unknown, and can only be hurt bladed weapons. 
%

#20 - Law of Militaristic Unreliability: Huge galaxy-wide armadas, entire
armies, and large war-machines full of cruel, heartless, bloodthirsty
warriors can be stopped and defeated with a single insignificant example
of a caring/loving emotion or a song.

#21 - Law of Tactical Unreliability: Tactical geniuses aren't....

#22 - Law of Inconsequential Undetectability: People never notice the
little things.... Like a missing body part, or wounds the size of Seattle.

#23 - Law of Juvenile Intellectuality: Children are smarter than
adults. And almost always twice as annoying.

#24 - Law of Antagonistic Americanthropomorphism: The really nasty 'Bad
Guys' are always skinny Americans. 
%
The 25 Laws of Japanese Animation
#25 - Law of Americanthropomorphistic Intellectual Inferiority: The stupid
'Good Guys' are always big Americans. 

	First Corollary: The only people who are more stupid than the big dumb
	Americans are the American translators. (Sometimes referred to as the
	Green Line Effect) 

	Second Corollary: The only people who are more stupid than the American
	translators are the American editors and censors.
