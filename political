If mankind minus one were of one opinion, then mankind is no more justified 
in silencing the one than the one - if he had the power - would be justified 
in silencing mankind.

The United States has one strategic interest in the Middle East: oil.
Everything else is gravy, sentiment, rhetoric... American transnational
corporations do not care about Israeli settlers and their biblical claims,
Palestinians who are losing their land and water, Kurds who are caught
stateless between gangsters in Baghdad and Tehran, victims of war or torture
in Sudan, Afghanistan, Algeria, South Lebanon...  --Charles Glass, New
Statesman, November 15, 1996

To announce that there must be no criticism of the president, or that we
are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and
servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.

Why of course the people don't want war. . . . That is understood. But,
after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and
it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a
democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist
dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the
bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they
are being attacked, and denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism
and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.
--Hermann Goering, Nazi officer, during his Nuremberg war crimes trial
