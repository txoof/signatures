In watermelon sugar the deeds were done and done again as my life is done
in watermelon sugar. I'll tell you about it because I am here and you 
are distant.

Our lives we have carefully constructed from watermelon sugar and then 
traveled to the length of our dreams, along roads lined with pines 
and stones.

  I live in a shack near iDEATH. I can see iDEATH out the window. It is 
beautiful. I can also see it with my eyes closed and touch it. Right now it 
is cold and turns like something in the hand of a child. I do not know 
what that thing could be.

    Your necklace is leaking
    and blue light drips
    from your beads to cover
    your beautiful breasts
    with a clear African dawn.
