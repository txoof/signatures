Oh Estel, I took you home that night/ My wife above the common law/
Laid it up like we always do in the hammock of the back yard/
Swinging like a rocking horse cannonballing down a track/
We both found heaven right then/ You just chose not to come back

Slept I have in the beds of middle America/ Life off the fat of
the man/ I'm gonna go out tonight/ I'm gonna try to make it/
Live as fast as I can

Off the freeway a dream light burns/ the ultimate take in the land of 
returns/ with a glycerine smile and a tear for tragedy/ something grand
that Judy left for me/ nothing more than box office history
