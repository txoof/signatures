Marionettes on weakening cables 
Huddled up with fear and hate 
Because they know their fate and it's a lot to put them through.

Untie me, I've said no vows/ The train is getting way too loud
I gotta leave here my girl/ Get on with my lonely life
Just leave the ring on the rail/ For the wheels to nullify
