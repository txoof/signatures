If a person offend you, and you are in doubt as to whether it was 
intentional or not, do not resort to extreme measures; simply watch your 
chance and hit him with a brick. That will be sufficient. If you shall 
find that he had not intended any offense, come out frankly and confess 
yourself in the wrong when you struck him; acknowledge it like a man and 
say you didn't mean to.
