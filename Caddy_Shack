And I say, "Hey, Lama, hey, how about a little something, you know, for the 
effort, you know." And he says, "Oh, uh, there will  be no money, but when 
you die, on your deathbed, you will receive total consciousness." So I 
got that goin' for me, which is nice.

This is a hybrid. This is a cross, ah, of Bluegrass, Kentucky Bluegrass, 
Featherbed Bent, and Northern California Sensemilia. The amazing stuff 
about this is, that you can play 36 holes on it in the afternoon, take it 
home and just get stoned to the bejeezus-belt that night on this stuff.
