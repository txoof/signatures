You'll dance to anything by any bunch of stupid Europeans who come over here
with their big hairdos intent on taking our money instead of giving your
cash, where it belongs, to a decent American artist like myself!

I said, 'JUMPIN JESUS ON A POGO STICK!' Everybody knows that the
burrow owl lives in a hole, in the ground; why the hell do you think they 
call it a burrow owl?!

The man said, 'Keep your head and arms inside the mixer at all
times.'  But Bill Junior, he was a DARE DEVIL, just like his old man; he
was leanin' out sayin, 'Look at me, look at me!'  POW!  He was 
DECAPITATED!  They found his head over by the snow-cone concessions.

It was durring my second senior year when mom found Jesus Christ.  His
spirit was trapped inside an old Minas Chivas bottle that she picked out of 
the dumpster behind the 7-11.

Mom brought the bottle inside and set it down on top of the TV; then she told
all us kids to gather 'round.  And then she explained how Jesus lived in the 
bottle and how, if she wanted to, she could call him out to do her bidding. 
Sis said it reminded her of an old TV show.  Mom slapped her and called her
a heritic.  I didn't say anything because I could still remember that time
outside of the Safeway when it took four security gards to hold mom down.

Mommy, she loved Jesus, but not like others did/ for she had a special bottle 
in which our savior lived/ she could unleash his vengance by unfastening the
lid

As the year went on, things went from bad to worse and I realized that if 
there wasn't a big change soon, I'd never get a date for the prom.  I couldn't 
go the year before because mom belonged to a church that beleived dancing to be
a one way ticket to hell.
