You've got to prime the pump you must have faith and believe/
you've got to give of yourself before you're worthy to receive/  
Drink all the water you can hold, wash your face cool your feet/
leave the bottle full for others/  
Thank you kindly, Desert Pete.

choose not to decide, you still have made a choice/ You can choose from
phantom fears and kindness that can kill/ I will choose a purpose here/ I
will choose free will
