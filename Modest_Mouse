Oh we ate all of the oranges
Off the navels of our lovers
Grabbed a book and read the cover

You missed when time and life shook hands and said goodbye
When I fell to my knees in tears, pray tell
And said, "Good luck, for your sake, I hope heaven and hell
Are really there, but I wouldn't hold my breath"
You wasted life, why wouldn't you waste death?

You tell me what you want and I'll tell you what you get.
You get away from me, you get away from me.

Hard-wired to concieve, so much we'd have to stow it
Even needs have needs, tiny giants made of tinier giants
Don't wear eyelids so I don't miss the last laugh of this show
	--Modest Mouse, Dashboard
