This here is the place where I'll be staying/  There isn't a number.  You
can call the pay phone/  Let it ring a long, long, long, long time/ If I
don't pickup, hangup/ call back and let it ring some more

Watch your heel crush crushed/ uh-oh, this means no fear cavalier/
Renegade steer clear/ A tournament, tournament, a tournament of lies.

I am, I am Superman/ and I know what's happening/ I am Superman and I can do
anything

You, I thought you knew me, this one laughing quietly underneath my
breath.

Nightswimming deserves a quiet night/ I'm not sure all these people
understand/ It's not like years ago/ the fear of getting caught/ the
recklessness of water/ They can not see me naked/ These things, they go
away, replaced by everyday.

Not everyone can carry the weight of the world/ Talk about the passion.
